# AR Animal Models with Animation and Sound

This project showcases **4 different Augmented Reality (AR) animal experiences** using **A-Frame** and **AR.js**. Each HTML file displays a unique animated 3D model with sound that plays when the AR marker is detected.


## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox)
- A webcam or phone camera
- Internet connection (for loading A-Frame and AR.js libraries)
- A printed **Hiro marker** ([Download Here](https://stemkoski.github.io/AR-Examples/markers/hiro.png))

> 💡 No server needed — you can run the HTML files directly in your browser!


## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to launch the AR project locally using `local-web-server` with HTTPS.

### 1. 📦 Install Local Web Server
- Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then install the web server globally:
- npm install -g local-web-server

### 2. 🧭 Navigate to the Project Folder
- cd path/to/ar-animal-models

### 3. 🔐 Run the Server with HTTPS
- ws --https

### 4. 🌐 Open in Browser
- Once the server starts, it will display a local HTTPS URL (e.g., https://localhost:8000). Open it in your mobile browser.

### 5. 🖨️ Show the Marker
- Print or display the Hiro marker:
- Hold it in front of your webcam.
- The 3D model will appear, animate, and play sound.

### 6. 🔊 Unlock Audio
